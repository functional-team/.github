# Functional

We are highly specialized in cloud-native stacks on Azure and Kubernetes with a track record of designing,  
building and maintaining data-intense applications in Enterprise settings.  
Our team is entirely based in Germany and most of us have been working together for years in leading companies like Allianz.  
Breaking away from the traditional corporate model we did set up functional as an independent employee-owned firm.  
Today we augment the engineering teams of our customers to drive agility by accelerating their cloud journey.  

Our cooperative structure promotes autonomy and fosters ownership,  
which keeps everyone focused and ultimately it is a highly functional setup for both customers and employees.  
This includes the bigger idea of driving positive change by applying our skills on high-impact topics that serve the purpose of reducing our footprint on the planet.  

We are available. Get in touch to learn more.
